# Corona-School Development Environment

A zoo of Docker containers that contains all backends and frontends,
as well as a Docker Compose config which additionally sets up redis and postgres.

To set up, clone this repository (`dev-env`) into the same folder as all the other repositories (`backend`, `backend-screening`, `web-screening-app`, `web-screening-admin`). Copy the .dockerignore file into the parent directory `cp /root/dev-env/.dockerignore /root/.dockerignore`. Then install docker and run `docker-compose up` in this folder. To rebuild, use `docker-compose build`, then run up again. Don't worry, the first run will take quite a while, but further ones will be significantly faster (as most steps can be cached).

You can also only build / start parts of the landscape e.g. `docker-compose build backend && docker-compose up web-user-app` to rebuild the backend and start the user frontend on top of it.

You might want to disable CORS in your browser to make the webapps work.

This will reveal the following ports on your host:
- 3000 - The Web User App 
- 3000 - The Screening Admin (yeah, these two are on the same port unfortunately. Only run one of them at the same time)
- 3002 - The Screening App
- 5000 - The Backend
- 3001 - The Screening Backend
- 6379 - Redis 
- 5432 - PostgreSQL (username: dev_corona_school password: test)
